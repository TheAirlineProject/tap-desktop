	# All these accounts MUST then share the same primary group.

	# to the corresponding Git reference and vice versa.
	#
	# Explicit correspondence is set up between trunk directory and master reference ('trunk' option)
	# and simple patterns are used to map branches and tags ('branches' and 'tags' options).
	#
	# Shelves are special branches used internally by SubGit to represent anonymous Git branches.
	# Shelves mapping is defined by the 'shelves' option.
	#
	# Generic mapping syntax is:
	#
	#     <Subversion-Path-Pattern>:<Git-Reference-Pattern>
	#
	# Explicit paths in place of patterns are used for trunk to master mapping.
	#
	# Subversion paths being matched against patterns are relative to the translation root
	# defined above.
	#
	# Pattern may only include single asterisk (*) as its last segment.
	# For example, patterns "branches/*", "branches/myproject/*", "branches/branchname" are supported,
	# and "branches/*/myproject", "branches/*/*", and "branches/release-*" are not supported.

	# (see http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html for 'revision dates' feature explanation).
