    made by CARNOC.com. The survey consists of comprehensive questionnaires answered by the passengers and analyzed by experts. 
    By early 2014, Xiamen Airlines has 6 branches in Fuzhou, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Changsha, and Beijing. The airline operates 218 domestic routes along with 26 international routes (Including routes to Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan). It flies over 3600 flights per week. XiamenAir ranks #4 among all Chinese carriers by domestic capacity (only less than the 'Big Three' national carriers), and contributes 7.2% of the domestic capacity in China.
